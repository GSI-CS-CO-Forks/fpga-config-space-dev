To generate a Wishbone memory map, we assume that all devices
are at 1KB addresses. This can be changed easily later.

To generate the firmware file for the spec board:

$ ./wb_fw wbone.def firmware.bin

The wbone.def file looks like this:

$ cat wbone.def 
#Vendor Device Subdevice Priority Class Version
      1      2         3        4     5       6
     10     11        12       13    14      15

The generated firmware file should be 4KB in size.
