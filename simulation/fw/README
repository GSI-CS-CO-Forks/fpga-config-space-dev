Generating Firmware
===================

To generate a Wishbone memory map, we assume that all devices
are at 1KB addresses. This can be changed easily later.

To generate the firmware file for the spec board:

$ ./wb_addrgen wbone.def firmware.bin

The wbone.def file looks like this:

$ cat wbone.def 
#Vendor Device Subdevice Priority Class Version
      1      2         3        4     5       6
     10     11        12       13    14      15

Installing Firmware
===================

The generated firmware file should be 4KB in size.
copy the firmware file into /lib/firmware/NAME
NAME is as specified in the driver

For the spec driver, the firmware name is expected to be 
"fakespec-VENDORID-DEVICEID".

Default Vendor ID (4 bytes): 0x0000babe
Default Device ID (2 bytes): 0xbabe

$ cp firmware.bin /lib/firmware/fakespec-0000babe-babe
